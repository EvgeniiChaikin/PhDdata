1. An example of how to generate ICs for the hypercube (HC) with the full COLIBRE model is given in `example_hypercube_reference_model' directory

- The default parameter file is `colibre_50Mpc_376.yml'
- Running python script `create_hypercube.py' will create the ICs for 40 runs of the hypercube. This script uses `numpy' and `swiftemulator' packages

2. The hypercubes for the other three models are created in the same way, except that

- the ModelSpecification parameters in the script should be different. The relevant parameters to look for are
  SNII_delta_T_K_min:               3.16228e6            
  SNII_delta_T_K_max:               3.16228e7  
  SNIa_delta_T_K_min:               3.16228e6            
  SNIa_delta_T_K_max:               3.16228e7             
  SNII_f_kinetic:                   0.1             
  SNII_energy_fraction_min:         0.1             
  SNII_energy_fraction_max:         3.5  
from the COLIBREFeedback parameter section in `colibre_50Mpc_376.yml' 

Note that:
- To ensure that all runs in the hypercube have no kinetic feedback one needs to set `setting SNII_f_kinetic = 0.0'
- To ensure that all runs in the hypercube have a constant heating temperature in SNII thermal feedback, one needs to set `SNII_delta_T_K_min' and `SNII_delta_T_K_max' to the same value
- `number_of_simulations' in `create_hypercube.py' may need to be changed from 40 to 32 for HC2 and to 24 for HC1
- To ensure that the energy in SN feedback is constant (such as in HC 1, 2, and 3), one needs to add 
"""
for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    model_parameters[f"{i}"]["COLIBREFeedback:SNII_energy_fraction_min"] = model_parameters_for_file[f"{i}"]["COLIBREFeedback:SNII_energy_fraction_max"]
"""
to `create_hypercube.py'.

3. Running the pipeline on the finished runs (see https://github.com/SWIFTSIM/pipeline) will create data_000X.yml files with processed galaxy properties.

4. After data_000X.yml file is available for each run of the hypercube, one can run the script emulate.py. It requires libraries such as
- tqdm
- corner
- emcee
- astropy,
which can all be pip-installed.

5. emulate.py will find the best-fitting parameter values by creating emulators, training them on the hypercube's data, and then fitting them to the observed GSMF and SSM.
