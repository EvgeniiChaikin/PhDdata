1. The script `create_hypercube' creates initial conditions for running hypercubes. It requires
- swiftemulator
- numpy

2. The `emulate.py' script creates emulators based on the runs from the hypercube of a given model,
runs MCMC to find the best-fitting parameter value, and creates plots with the posterior distributions as well as diagnostics plots

Running `emulate.py' requires
- swiftemulator
- numpy
- matplotlib
- velociraptor-python
- emcee
- corner
- unyt
- astropy
- tqdm

All libraries can be pip-installed.

3. The observatinal data used in this chapter are available at https://github.com/SWIFTSIM/velociraptor-comparison-data

4. The code for making plots such as

- Galaxy stellar mass function
- Median galaxy half-mass size vs. stellar mass
- sSFR vs. stellar mass
- SMBH mass vs. stellar mass 
- Galaxy passive fraction vs. stellar mass
- H2 mass fraction vs. stellar mass
- HI mass fraction vs. stellar mass
- Gas metallicity vs. stellar mass
- Stellar metallicity vs. stellar mass 
- Stellar-to-halo mass ratio vs. halo mass

can be found at https://github.com/SWIFTSIM/pipeline-configs

5. The script `convert_SFH.py' convers the cosmic star formation history from the hypercube runs from .txt format to .yml format. 
The latter is read by `emulate.py'.

6. Note that making plots requires halo catalogues in the velociraptor or SOAP format. The latter can be found at https://github.com/SWIFTSIM/SOAP
and the velociraptor is available at https://velociraptor-stf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting.html
